Repository contains various scripts from my Bioinformaticcs placement at John Innes in the Wulff Lab. The project involved using an association genetics pipeline called AgRenSeq (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-018-0007-9), to identify candidate genes that give resistance to a disease of wheat called Stripe Rust.

Notes:
- Most scripts will be hard to understand without domain specific knowledge.
- No raw data is available here as it may be proprietary, and the sequencing data would be too large to upload anyway.
